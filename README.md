# BTools
BTools is a convienent way to install commonly used Bioinformatic tools from the publicly available source files, here at Github, using R.
## 1. Description
BTools simplifies the installation process of some commonly Bioinformatics tools making them inmmediatly available to use.

**Tools:**
* [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC):  A quality control analysis tool for high throughput sequencing data 
* [skewer](https://github.com/relipmoc/skewer): Tool for processing next-generation sequencing (NGS) paired-end sequences
* [bedtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2): Bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks
* [libgtextutils](https://github.com/agordon/libgtextutils): The FASTX-Toolkit text manipulation library
* [fastx_toolkit](https://github.com/agordon/fastx_toolkit): The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing
* [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa): Burrow-Wheeler Aligner for short-read alignment
* [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib): C library for high-throughput sequencing data formats 
* [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/):Tools (written in C using htslib) for manipulating next-generation sequencing data
* [picard](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard): A set of command line tools (in Java) for manipulating high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data and formats such as SAM/BAM/CRAM and VCF
* [hmmcopy_utils](https://github.com/shahcompbio/hmmcopy_utils): Tools for extracting read counts and gc and mappability statistics in preparation for running HMMCopy
